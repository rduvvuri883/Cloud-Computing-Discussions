It has a distributed file system, called Hadoop Distributed File System or HDFS, which enables fast data transfer among the nodes.

2) What are the key differences between Hadoop and Spark?

Hadoop can be used for:

-> Linear processing of huge data sets
-> Economical solution and more of long term solutions

Spark is effective for:

-> Fast data processing
-> Iterative processing
-> Near real-time processing
-> Graph processing
-> Machine learning
-> Joining datasets
