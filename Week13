1) What problems does edge-based machine learning solve?

Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the devices where itâ€™s being gathered. Compared to relying on a central location like a cloud, Edge Computing allows real-time data to not suffer bandwidth and latency issues which affect app performance.

To put in simpler terms, instead of running processes in the cloud, Edge Computing runs processes on local places like a computer, IoT device or Edge Server. By bringing computation to a network edge, long-distance communication between a client and server is now being reduced.
